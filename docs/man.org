vericert - A formally verified high-level synthesis tool.

* SYNOPSYS

*vericert* [ *OPTION* ]... [ *FILE* ]...

* DESCRIPTION

** HLS Options

- --no-hls :: Do not use HLS and generate standard flow
- --simulate :: Simulate the result with the Verilog semantics

- -v :: Print external commands before invoking them
- -timings :: Show the time spent in various compiler passes
- -version :: Print the version string and exit
- -target <value> :: Generate code for the given target
- -conf <file> :: Read configuration from file
- @<file> :: Read command line options from <file>

** Tracing Options

- -dprepro :: Save C file after preprocessing in <file>.i
- -dparse :: Save C file after parsing and elaboration in <file>.parsed.c
- -dc :: Save generated C in <file>.compcert.c
- -dclight :: Save generated Clight in <file>.light.c
- -dcminor :: Save generated Cminor in <file>.cm
- -drtl :: Save RTL at various optimization points in <file>.rtl.<n>
- -drtlblock :: Save RTLBlock <file>.rtlblock
- -dhtl :: Save HTL before Verilog generation <file>.htl
- -dltl :: Save LTL after register allocation in <file>.ltl
- -dmach :: Save generated Mach code in <file>.mach
- -dasm :: Save generated assembly in <file>.s
- -dall :: Save all generated intermediate files in <file>.<ext>
- -sdump :: Save info for post-linking validation in <file>.json
- -o <file> :: Generate output in <file>

** Diagnostic options

- -Wall :: Enable all warnings
- -W<warning> :: Enable the specific <warning>
- -Wno-<warning> :: Disable the specific <warning>
- -Werror :: Make all warnings into errors
- -Werror=<warning> :: Turn <warning> into an error
- -Wno-error=<warning> :: Turn <warning> into a warning even if -Werror is specified
- -Wfatal-errors :: Turn all errors into fatal errors aborting the compilation
- -fdiagnostics-color :: Turn on colored diagnostics
- -fno-diagnostics-color :: Turn of colored diagnostics
- -fmax-errors=<n> :: Maximum number of errors to report
